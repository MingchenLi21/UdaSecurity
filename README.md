# UdaSecurity

This is a project from Udacity.

This home security application tracks the status of sensors, monitors camera input, 
and changes the alarm state of the system based on inputs.
 Users can arm the system for when theyâ€™re home or away as well as disarm the system.

 I wrote unit tests for all of the major operations the application performs
  so that changes can be safely made in the future
and also need to use maven to streamline the build process and automate tests and code analysis.
Writing thorough unit tests will help find any bugs that already exist.

And separated the Image Service from the program and
 package it as a separate module to be included both in this project and in other projects.

Finally, updated the build process to automatically run unit tests, perform static code analysis, and build the code into an executable jar file.
